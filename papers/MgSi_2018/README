This is the dataset of 358 low-energy atomic structures predicted for 13 Mg-Si binary 
compounds. Files are given in CIF format and named as struct-i-p.cif where i is the 
index of the structures at 0 GPa (1 for lowest energy, and higher i for higher energy), 
and p is the pressure in GPa. Details on this dataset can be found at
